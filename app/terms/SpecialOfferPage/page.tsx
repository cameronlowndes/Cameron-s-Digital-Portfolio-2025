            <p>This offer is available exclusively to verified:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Registered charities with a valid charity number</li>
              <li>Small businesses with fewer than 10 employees and under Â£200,000 annual turnover</li>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Scope of Services</h2>
            <p>
              The services offered under this program include a set of predefined packages, which may consist of custom design, responsive development, basic SEO setup, integration of contact forms, and CMS setup (e.g., WordPress, Next.js). Additional services such as eCommerce functionality, advanced animations, API integrations, or copywriting are not included unless specifically agreed upon in writing and may incur extra fees.

          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">3. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>
              Full payment is typically required upfront before development begins. However, for eligible applicants, flexible payment plans are available. These may involve an initial upfront payment followed by monthly installments over a 12-month period. All payment agreements must be finalized and documented in writing prior to the start of the project. Work will not commence until the first payment is received.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">4. Timeline & Communication</h2>
            <p>
              A detailed project timeline will be shared with the client at the start of the engagement. Estimated delivery times are dependent on timely feedback and provision of necessary materials (e.g. text, images, branding). If the client fails to respond within 7 days at any point during the project, the timeline may be extended or the project paused. Clear and ongoing communication is critical to ensuring a smooth development process.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">5. Cancellation & Refunds</h2>
            <p>
              All payments are non-refundable once development work has begun. If a project is cancelled before any work starts, a partial refund may be issued at the discretion of the developer, minus any time spent on consultation or planning. In the event of a payment plan, the client remains responsible for completing scheduled payments as per the agreed contract.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">6. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
              Upon full payment, the client receives full ownership of the final website and its assets. This includes all code, content, and designs unless third-party licenses or software are used (e.g. stock photos, plugins), in which case license terms will apply. The developer retains the right to display completed work in a personal or professional portfolio.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">7. Fair Use Clause</h2>
            <p>
              This discounted offer is extended to support charities and small businesses making a positive impact. Any misuse, including reselling the service, submitting false information to qualify, or requesting excessive changes beyond the agreed scope, may result in immediate cancellation without refund and may be subject to legal action. The developer reserves the right to deny service if abuse is suspected.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">8. Ongoing Maintenance</h2>
            <p>
              Ongoing maintenance, such as software updates, bug fixes, backups, and content updates, is not included by default. Maintenance packages can be purchased as monthly add-ons and are billed separately. Clients who opt-in can cancel with 14 daysâ€™ written notice. Emergency support is available but may be billed at an hourly rate if no plan is in place.
