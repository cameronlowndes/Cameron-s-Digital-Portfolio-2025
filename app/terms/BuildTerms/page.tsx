            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">1. Project Timeline & Delivery</h2>
            <p>
              Project timelines vary depending on package and project complexity. Timelines start only once the client has provided all necessary content, assets, branding materials, and approvals.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Starter:</strong> Estimated 5â€“7 business days</li>
              <li><strong>Professional:</strong> Estimated 10â€“14 business days</li>
              <li><strong>Premium:</strong> Timeline custom; agreed before project start</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Any delays in client feedback or asset delivery may extend the timeline.

          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">2. Revisions</h2>
            <p>
              Revisions are an important part of the process. To keep the project on track, revision rounds are limited per package:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Starter:</strong> 1 revision round included</li>
              <li><strong>Professional:</strong> 2 revision rounds included</li>
              <li><strong>Premium:</strong> Unlimited revisions within the agreed scope</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Additional revisions or changes beyond the original scope will incur extra fees billed at Â£50/hour.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">3. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>
              To secure your project start date, a deposit is required:

            <p className="mt-2">

            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">4. Deliverables & Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
              Upon receipt of full payment, all source files, website code, and assets created specifically for your project become your property.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
